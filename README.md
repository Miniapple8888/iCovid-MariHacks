# Ideas COVID 19

    - Web app
    - Simulate / Predict COVID-19 models like Plague Inc.
    - Use data like covid cases, locations, population density, etc.
    - Use map to display simulation
    - Use user start input for sim
    - Self analysis : User personal statistics predictions (likely of getting of virus)

# Technologies

     - Tensorflow (machine learning)
     - Node.js / Javascript => web app
     - View.js

# COVID-19 Modelling

Develop a computer program that can predict the future infection rates of variants. Curve fitting and Monte Carlo simulations would be a great add-on. In addition, a bonus point would be to simulate in a video game setting how certain actions can have an effect on case numbers.
